/*
Challenge 1:

  - Use express.Router() to export a router called productsRouter

   It should mount the '/api/products' and '/api/products/genres' routes.
   These should use the two functions from productsControllers.js: getProducts() and getGenres().
   Be careful here - what is the common pitfall?

   hint.md for help!
*/

import express from 'express'
import { getProducts, getGenres } from '../controllers/productsControllers.js'

export const productsRouter = express.Router()

productsRouter.get('/genres', getGenres)

productsRouter.get('/', getProducts)
